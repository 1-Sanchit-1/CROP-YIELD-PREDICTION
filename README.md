## Overview

Crop Yield Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the yield of crops based on various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, and crop type. This project leverages historical data on crop yield and environmental factors to build predictive models that can forecast future crop yields.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw data to prepare it for model training.
- Model Training: Utilize machine learning algorithms to train predictive models on historical crop yield and environmental data.
- Prediction: Use trained models to make predictions on future crop yields based on input parameters.
- Visualization: Visualize data, model performance, and prediction results using charts and graphs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1-Sanchit-1/CROP-YIELD-PREDICTION
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and contains relevant features such as weather data, soil information, and crop type.
2. Train the model: Run the training script to train the predictive model using your dataset.
3. Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data points or future time periods.
4. Visualize results: Visualize the prediction results using the provided visualization tools and scripts.
